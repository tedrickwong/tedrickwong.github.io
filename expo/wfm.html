					<p>The <a href="https://newsroom.edison.com/releases/southern-california-edison-files-2019-wildfire-mitigation-plan">Wildfire Mitigation Plan</a>
					is intended to reduce fires caused by utility infrastructure. This effort consists of conducting inspections
					in high fire risk areas (HFRA) to detect any potentially faulty infrastructure. If an issue arises, what's called a Notification is generated.
					This Notification is then efficiently scheduled in Primavera P6. Additionally, it is also bundled with other work orders in the same vicinity 
					to help streamline work.</p>
					<p>Leveraging the scheduling of Notifications helps provide data for us to generate visual reports. These reports are intended to be utilized
					for supervisors and managers in regions and districts to assist with resource planning. The reports also allow for remediation of bottlenecks 
					by visualizing where dependencies lie.</p>
					<p>My role is to ensure that the data in our reports is consistent with what districts and regions currently use. I developed a form to log and
					track issues discovered during data validation. I also help to investigate and resolve these issues and create metrics to help gauge issue
					remediation progress. Apart from the data, I work to ensure that data in our reports is displayed in a way that is easily digestible by its
					intended audience. This entails applying good UI/UX fundamentals to the charts and metrics displayed on an "Executive" level dashboard.</p>

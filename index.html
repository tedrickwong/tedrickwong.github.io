						enhances or simplifies some aspect of my daily life. Most of my experience is in Python, 
						HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. I also have good exposure to C++, MySQL, VBA, and Java. 
						Mainly looking for Software Engineering, Web Development, Project Management, and IT roles
						in both the public and private sector.

                        Ethereum, Monero, etc. I currently have an online Monero miner that you can visit and contribute to

			<p style="font-size:14px;margin-bottom:0;">Transmission & Distribution - Work Management - Intern</p>
			<p style="font-size:14px;">June 2019 - Present</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			I am designing and implementing a program that automates the Transmission Pole Project
			creation process by utilizing C55 data and transforming it into a format that can be uploaded 
			to the Trans DM Bulk Uploader. I am also working on code that will automatically generate a report
			that shows all Transmission and Distribution Pole Projects in C55 which are ATP (Authorized to Proceed) for Design. 
			I, along with two other interns, were able to streamline the 
			process flow for employee on-boarding by requiring all pertinent information to be retrieved 
			up front. This reduces the amount of time a	new employee has to wait for hardware, software, 
			as well as fileshare and other access. Additionally, I am assisting in the development of 
			reporting tools that allow for visibility of High Fire work and improved resource planning 
			as a part of the Wildfire Mitigation effort.</p>

			My duties mainly consisted of preparing systems for provisioning through the use of Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT) and Clonezilla,
			governance of the life cycle of various systems managed by IT,
			timely completion of IT Service Requests (ITSR),

			<p style="font-size:14px;">January 2018 - October 2019</p>
			<p style="text-align:justify">
			I developed various PHP and MySQL form-based web applications which impacted both the student body as well as administrators.
			One major project I developed consisted of a course registration form that instructors to populated and admin tools that allowed coordinators to properly manage this information.
			Another project was for coordinators at the annual SPOP (Student Parent Orientation Program) which gave visibility to the number of tasks each coordinator was assigned to for a specific program and what each of the tasks were. 
			I mainly supported the Office of the Dean of Students, but also was involved in Campus Organizations, Veteran Services, All-U Student Leadership Conference, Office of Academic Integrity & Student Conduct, and Orientation.
			Most of my duties involved me creating and updating database tables in phpMyAdmin.</p>
